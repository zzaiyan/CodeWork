### <center>A Proposal for Improving Service of School Clinic</center>

There are many students complaining about the understaffing and inadequate resources of our school clinic. In order to enhance the clinic’s service, I’d love to write a proposal about some suggestions to address the current problems.

A number of factors might contribute to this phenomenon. In view of the seriousness of the problem mentioned, effective measures should be taken. To begin with, in case of emergent situations, the school clinic need to extend its opening hours and provide a 24-hour emergency call service. Moreover, in order to cope with different kinds of symptoms, the school clinic should prepare a few more varieties of common medicines. Lastly, it would be nice if the school clinic could regularly organize activities to spread healthcare knowledge among teachers and students.

As an indispensable component of our campus, the school clinic should better ensure the well-being of the students as well as the teaching staff. I look forward to its further improvement and I hope my proposal could be adopted. 

# Part IV - Translation

Once upon a time, a farmer was working on his field, and meanwhile he saw a rabbit dashing past and crashing into a large tree and dying. Filled with delights, the farmer had eating the rabbit without any trouble. He thought, "How nice it will be if it were always going like this! " So he stopped working and waited under the tree every day for another rabbit to be picked up from the tree. He wait and wait and the days passed by until the field was deserted, but he had never got one more rabbit. From then on, people laughed at him for his taking the chance for granted.
