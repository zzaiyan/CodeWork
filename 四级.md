### Do violent video games lead to violence?

The explosive growth of video games in recent years has aroused grave social concern.  The most intense one of them is  whether violence elements in video games can cause violence in real world. Some believe that video games are harmless, meanwhile, others are convinced that there are some links between violent games and violent action of the young.

The answer of mine is actually yes and there are two reasons. Firstly, unlike TV or books, video games are more interactive, thus those who play video games are more likely to be fully engaged, so they probably are unable to distinguish the reality from the virtual world. Secondly, children are not as self-disciplined as adults. Video games with violence contents can have negative effects on their developing minds in a long time so it is possible to influence the real life.

Given by many teenagers are spending a huge amount of time and money on video games, we need to be alert to the possible harm of violent games that could be done to children. Only by doing so can we ensure the healthy development of children.
